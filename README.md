## Tech Stack

The tech stack was listed down and named by name itself in the current repository (followed 3-times rule).

```
I follow what I call the '3-times rule.' If I encounter a concept or term that confuses or blocks my understanding three or more times, I take it as a sign that the topic is not straightforwardâ€”at least for me. At that point, I know it's worth investing my time to explore it more deeply and build a simple demo to investigate and better understand the idea in practice.
