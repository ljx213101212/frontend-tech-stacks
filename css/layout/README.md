### block vs inline

- block
    - start on a new line in the document flow
    - take up the full available width and expand to fill their parent container horizontally.
    - can set width, height to control the size and spacing of block-level elements.

- inline
    - will stay in current line in document flow
    - only occupy the space required by their content
    - can't set properties like width and height


### margin vs padding

- margin
    - Creates extra space around an element, outside the border.
- padding
    - Creates extra space within an element, between the content and the border.
