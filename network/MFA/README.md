### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

Purpose: Enhances security by requiring users to verify their identity using **multiple** factors (e.g., password, OTP, fingerprint).
Focus: **Strengthening** security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Example: Logging into a banking app may require a password (something you know) **+** an OTP sent to your phone (something you have).


### SSO (Single Sign-On)

Purpose: Simplifies user authentication by allowing users to **log in once** and **access multiple** applications or systems without needing to log in again for each system.
Focus: User **convenience** and seamless access.
Example: After logging into Google, you can access Gmail, Google Drive, YouTube, etc., without additional logins.

SSO and MFA are often used together to provide both **convenience (SSO)** and **security (MFA)**.
