### Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enhances the development experience with server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.

#### Key Concepts

- **Server Components**: Render only on the server.
- **Client Components**: Render on the server for initial HTML, then hydrate on the client.

### Routing

Understanding the routing mechanisms is crucial for building efficient React applications.

#### TODO

- [ ] Understand the mechanism of Next Router vs React Router DOM
- [ ] Implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a router to grasp the root causes of conflicts between different routing solutions
